# PPLWorkOut



Project Plan Scope:

Project Objective: To create a console app using c+ that will generate an exercise program for the user. The user will select the type of workout they would like to perform (push, pull, or legs), determine the number of exercises they would like, and using a calculation of one-rep-max, the app will generate a workout routine for the user.

This will involve some simple questions to acquire data from the user (workout type, number of exercises, etc.). 

Statement of Work: 
•	The project will use WriteLine and ReadLine functions to acquire information from the user.
•	Once data is acquired, the app will use if else statements to determine the corresponding workout with set information.
•	Based on the information entered by the user, the weight range and reps will be determined for the workout.
•	Using separate classes, the workout information will be pulled to display to the user.
•	Using functions, the details of each workout (name, description, equipment needed, etc.) will also display to the user.
•	For additional exercises, have a list that workouts can be pulled from.
•	Create loop that will allow user to either end program or add more workouts.
•	Possibility of adding log that will track previous workouts.

Project Features:
•	Master loop that will allow the user to enter commands (additional workouts) and ability to exit/end.
•	Additional classes with inherited properties.
•	Using a list, pull values for various exercises to be used within the app.
•	Considering adding a log that will record previously completed workouts.
•	Also considering adding code to pull current date to apply it to workout log
