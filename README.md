# PPLWorkOut

The PPLWorkOut Program is designed to provide the user with a simple workout program based on either a push, pull, or leg routine. After a program is chosen, weights and exercises are listed based on the user's 1RM (1 rep max).

This solves the guesswork for planning a workout.

Features:

Feature 1: Implements a "master loop" where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.
Feature 2: Additional classes that inherit one or more properties from its parent
Feature 3: Build a conversion tool that converts user input to another type and displays it
Feature 4 (pending):  Implement a log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file

Instructions:
1. Clone Project to local machine
2. Choose options 1, 2, or 3 for desired workout type (push, pull, legs).
3. Enter 1RM (1 rep max) for primary lift associated to workout type (bench press, deadlift, squat).
4. Choose number of desired workouts.
5. Workouts and weights are displayed to user.
6. At end of workout, user can choose to enter another workout (Y) or close the program (N).

Feature usage:
1. Master loop where user can enter a single or multiple workout options, or exit the program.
2. Multiple classes that inherit properties from general exercise parent class.
3. Weights and rep schemes are converted based on the user's 1RM to determine the user's working weights.
4. (pending)User input in stored in a text file where previous entries can be viewed.
